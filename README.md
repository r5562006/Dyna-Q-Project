# Dyna-Q Project

This project demonstrates the use of the Dyna-Q algorithm for reinforcement learning. The script trains a Dyna-Q agent on the FrozenLake-v0 environment and prints the total reward for each episode.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `gym`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dyna_q_project.git
    cd dyna_q_project
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the script to train the Dyna-Q agent:
```sh
python dyna_q.py
